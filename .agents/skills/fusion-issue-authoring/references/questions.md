# Clarifying questions

Use the smallest set of questions needed to draft a useful issue.

## Determine issue type

- Is this a new user-facing capability/workflow (Feature/User Story) or behind-the-scenes work (Task)?
- Is it focused on user workflow (User Story) or product capability (Feature)?

## All issue types

- Which repository should this issue be created/updated in?
- What is the core problem or need?
- Which teams/systems are affected?
- What is the priority or urgency?
- Are there existing related issues?
- What are the success criteria?
- Which labels from this repository should be applied (or should we skip labels)?
- Should this be assigned, and if so to whom (`@me` or specific login)?

## Draft review gate (before publish/update)

- Does this draft content match what you want to send?
- What should be changed in title/body/scope before publishing?
- Do you want to publish this draft now, or revise further?

## Feature-specific

- What capability or enhancement is needed?
- Why is this valuable and urgent?
- What are scope boundaries or non-goals?
- How will success be measured?

## User story-specific

- Who is the user/role?
- What workflow needs improvement?
- What blocks them today?
- What Given/When/Then scenarios matter most?

## Task-specific

- Which service/module/codebase area is affected?
- What concrete work is needed (fix/refactor/config/test/migration)?
- What dependencies or risks exist?
- How will completion be validated?
- Should this issue type be explicitly set to `Task` after creation?

## Task checklist shaping

- Should this be split into multiple small subtasks instead of one broad task?
- Which task should be drafted first for quickest progress?
- Are any tasks blockers/dependencies for others?
- Do you want suggested tasks as a checklist before drafting issues?
- Which tasks must block other tasks because they cannot start yet?
