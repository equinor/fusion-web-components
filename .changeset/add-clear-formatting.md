"@equinor/fusion-wc-markdown": patch
---

Add "Clear Formatting" functionality to markdown editor. The feature removes all formatting (marks, list items, block styles) from the selected text. Also adds a new menu item 'clear-format' for triggering the clear formatting action. Added prosemirror-transform dependency to support the implementation.
