Introduced new @equinor/fusion-web-components package - a unified collection package for Fusion web components. This package provides a convenient single entry point for importing Fusion web components, starting with the people components (PeoplePickerElement and PeopleViewerElement). The package re-exports components with proper TypeScript types, custom elements manifests, and subpath exports for flexible importing.
